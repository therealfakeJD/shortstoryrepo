Sometimes I read 4 or 5 books in a day.  I'll often see an equation on a chalkboard that no one can possibly solve and I'll just solve it.  I had abandonement issues and I don't feel like I'm good enough for anyone to love me.  My counselor often sits silent with me in our sessions because I'm so smart that I pretend to be a hard case and won't talk just to show him that I'm so smart.  

I am from Boston, MA.  There is a professor at Harvard who is obsessed with me and keeps telling my counselor how much potential I have but I don't see it that way.  At least he bailed me out of jail because of said "potential".  My best friend is Ben Affleck and he works with me at the construction site when we are not getting in trouble for fighting the police is Charlestown.  

The other day my girlfriend said she loved me and I completely freaked out on her cause I'm so smart I don't know If i can handle a relationship.  So I did what anyone would do and I looked her right back in the eyes and I told her that I didn't love her.  That'll teach her to tell me she loves me again.  I'm a tortured genius and I don't have time for that kind of thing.  Especially when my best friend is the new Batman.

Another thing I do with my buddy Ben Affleck is go to the batting cages. We have a great time because what we do is so funny.  Instead of letting the machine pitch the balls the for us we pitch the balls to each other OURSELVES!  We do this because Boston is our home town and people let us do whatever we want here.
